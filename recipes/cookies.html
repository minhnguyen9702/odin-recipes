    <p>A cookie is a baked or cooked snack or dessert that is typically small, flat and sweet. It usually contains
        flour, sugar, egg, and some type of oil, fat, or butter. It may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats,
        chocolate chips, nuts, etc.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup cornflakes cereal</li>
        <li>1 cup rolled oats</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>1 cup unsweetened flaked coconut</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Beat butter and sugars until fluffy. Slowly add oil and beat until oil is well incorporated. Add egg and
            vanilla, beat to mix.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine flour, soda and salt. Add to butter mixture and stir just until mixed. Combine corn
            flakes, oatmeal, nuts and coconut and add to cookie mixture; mix just until combined.</li>
        <li>Use a cookie scoop to produce consistently sized cookies, but you can drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto an
            ungreased cookie sheet, if you don't have a scoop. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 12 minutes or
            until lightly browned. Since these are so rich, you can chill the individual balls of cookie dough and then
            freeze them in freezer bags. You can then take them directly from the freezer to the oven, just add a few
            minutes to the cooking time.</li>
